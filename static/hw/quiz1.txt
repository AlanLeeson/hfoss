Fall 2015, Quiz #1

1) What is the name of the version control system we use in this course?



Bonus: Give the name for another version control system.



2) We refer to sites that host source code as "forges".  What is the name of
the primary forge used in this course?



3) Rearrange the items in the column on the right, as necessary, so that they
best match the names of key figures in the column on the left. 

For example:

A) Randall Munroe                    a) Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal
B) Zach Weiner                       b) XKCD
C) Walt Disney                       c) Mickey Mouse

becomes

A) Randall Munroe                    b) XKCD
B) Zach Weiner                       a) Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal
C) Walt Disney                       c) Mickey Mouse

So, rearrange these to make the best matches:

A) Andrew Tannenbaum                 a) Debian Free Software Guidelines
B) Linus Torvalds                    b) Free Software Foundation/Gnu Project
C) Richard Stallman                  c) Perl  
D) Brian Behlendorf                  d) Linux 
E) Larry Wall                        e) Minix 
F) Bruce Perens                      f) Apache



4) We discussed 5 concepts that are often lumped together under the term
"intellectual property".  Name 2 of them, and describe at least one way in
which the ones you've chosen differ from one another.



5) I've presented "the four R's" as a shorthand for the freedoms attached to
software for it to be considered "free and open source".  List or describe
each.  (If you cannot remember the "r term" I use, but can describe the
freedom involved, that also counts.)
